# Civo Marketplace Template

A templated makefile and various utlities to help in building out a [Civo Kubernetes Marketplace App](https://github.com/civo/kubernetes-marketplace).  The contents of this template would be copied into a subdirectory within the kubernetes-marketplace repo as a starting point.  

**Note:** This template will work by building out an app based on my [personal blog]() fro demonstration/testing purposes.  Please do NOT submit this app as-is to the Marketplace.
